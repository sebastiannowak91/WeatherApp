A Weather Application built with Angular. 
Demo: ðŸ”— [WeatherApp](https://sebastiannowak91.github.io/WeatherApp/)

During development process I used:

-	fetching data from API;
-	using services;
-	working with observables;
-	handling forms (reactive approach with built ones and custom validators);
-	changing pages with routing;
